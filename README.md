If you're interested in the work I was doing (webdev, CTF, general software engineering, competitive programming, game dev, etc) prior to 2022, you can read a more comprehensive account at my [about page](https://152334h.github.io).

If you are interested in how I pivoted to ML, see [here](https://github.com/152334H/152334H/blob/8e422e1ae2bd77db45485168a0c60b92ac8dbce2/README.md#ai-pivot).
