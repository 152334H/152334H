# Things I do
I am currently employed as a Machine Learning Engineer with [ElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io), so my GitHub is a bit sparse these days. Here are the public things I have done in the past:

* Machine Learning
  * Discord bot wrappers for multimodal LLMs like [OpenFlamingo](https://github.com/152334H/flamingo_discord_bot) and [MiniGPT-4](https://github.com/152334H/MiniGPT-4-discord-bot)
  * :turtle: TorToiSe-TTS [fast inference](https://github.com/152334H/tortoise-tts-fast) && [fine-tuning](https://github.com/152334H/DL-Art-School) 
  * (older) TalkNet [TTS models](https://152334h.github.io/disco-narrator/).
  * (2022) Using language models for [Code generation](https://github.com/152334H/Copilot-at-home) and [writing](https://github.com/152334H/gpt-j-editor)
  * Stable diffusion related work, which cannot be displayed in public for obvious reasons ðŸ™‚
* a [blog](https://152334h.github.io)

### old stuff
* [CTFs](https://github.com/IRS-Cybersec/ctfdump) (with [IRS-Cybersec](https://irscybersec.tk/)). 
  * [We organised one too](https://github.com/IRS-Cybersec/Sieberrsec-CTF-3.0)
  * I also made a [pwn](https://github.com/152334H/pwnscripts) library extension, but it's deprecated
* Webdev
  * Peronsal [React.js project](https://github.com/152334H/react-viewer-viewer) (and [REST API](https://github.com/152334H/react-viewer-viewer-api))
  * [TTS web service](https://github.com/152334H/CTN-webapp) (offline)
  * [GPT-J editor](https://github.com/152334H/gpt-j-editor)
  * [Hackathons](https://github.com/152334H/fithack-backend)
* basic [coding exercises](https://github.com/152334H/exercises) and [Advent of Code](https://github.com/152334H/aoc)
