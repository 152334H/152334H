I'm Sherman Chann (main), a former infosec/SWE guy now working as a Machine Learning Engineer at [ElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io).

## AI Pivot
Some time in early 2022 -- around the time stuff like [Copilot](https://copilot.github.com/) or [Gato](https://www.deepmind.com/blog/a-generalist-agent) or [Clippy](https://gwern.net/fiction/clippy) were published, I realised what the [important people](https://openai.com) had figured long ago: AGI is coming, nothing else matters, drop everything and work on this.

So, I did. Not in the strongest sense, but by the time ChatGPT rolled around, I had made:
* Some TalkNet [TTS models](https://152334h.github.io/disco-narrator/).
* Minor contributions and friends from the Stable Diffusion community
* Some basic fastapi wrappers around LLMs for [Code generation](https://github.com/152334H/Copilot-at-home) and [writing](https://github.com/152334H/gpt-j-editor) from huggingface

After that, I
* wasted about a month attempting to build a GPT-3-enabled [AI tutor](https://github.com/152334H/tutor.io/).
* Made some discord bot wrappers for multimodal LLMs like [OpenFlamingo](https://github.com/152334H/flamingo_discord_bot) and [MiniGPT-4](https://github.com/152334H/MiniGPT-4-discord-bot)
* Involved myself with ML discord/twitter a lot. Eleuther/Nous.
* Improved :turtle: TorToiSe-TTS with [fast inference](https://github.com/152334H/tortoise-tts-fast) && [fine-tuning](https://github.com/152334H/DL-Art-School)

Many TTS companies reached out to me for my work on Tortoise, and I eventually accepted a few offers. Although I'm deeply interested in the frontier space of LLM development, working for private startups has mostly hindered me from making any public contributions to that space since ~April.

## Pre-2022 era
If you're interested in the work I was doing (webdev, CTF, general software engineering, competitive programming, game dev, etc) prior to 2022, you can read a more comprehensive account at my [about page](https://152334h.github.io).
