# Pwn, Programming, Python

I used to do CTFs a lot, and I made [pwnscripts](https://github.com/152334H/pwnscripts) to automate the dirty work. Sometimes I make [writeups](https://github.com/IRS-Cybersec/ctfdump), along with the rest of [my team](https://irscybersec.tk/).

More recently, I kind-of organised [a local CTF](https://github.com/IRS-Cybersec/Sieberrsec-CTF-3.0) for pre-university students. I've also been learning [basic algorithm stuff](https://github.com/152334H/exercises) (plus [Advent of Code](https://github.com/152334H/aoc)) and [webdev](private repo! updates soon)

Python's my heart, but Rust is pretty cool too.
