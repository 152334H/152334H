# `whoami`
I'm Sherman Chann (main), a Machine Learning Engineer at [ElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io).

#### If you'd like to chat, please contact me over twitter/discord/[linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sherman-chann/)/email (username @ gmail).

Do not contact me for audio-related discussions; I obviously cannot say anything useful in that sector.

##### I have predominantly worked on LLMs for the past 2 years, and my knowledge in other areas is atrophied/irrelevant by now.

Rough breakdown of my experience (or lackthereof) coverage
* obvious basic knowledge (hf familiarity, basic finetuning, gpu poor tricks, inference engines, evals)
* small-scale pretraining ("[0-499](https://transparencyreport.google.com/user-data/us-national-security)" GPUs), mostly in pure pytorch / with transformerengine.

If you're interested in the work I was doing (webdev, CTF, general software engineering, competitive programming, game dev, etc) prior to 2022, you can read a more comprehensive account at my [about page](https://152334h.github.io).

If you are interested in how I pivoted to ML, see [here](https://github.com/152334H/152334H/blob/8e422e1ae2bd77db45485168a0c60b92ac8dbce2/README.md#ai-pivot).
